The URLs of entries are bound to change over the course of time. If you have many such entries, adding a redirect URL can be time consuming and requires manual efforts. Moreover, we also miss on adding a redirect URL due to human error.

Therefore, we have created a script that generates a redirect URL automatically every time the URL of any entry in any content type of a stack gets updated. This one time activity can save efforts and time required to do this manually
